~Average Video, showcasing the neighbors decently clustering but also shooting off in various directions:

~"Good" Video, showcasing that when the neighbors spawn correctly, they cluster like (I think) they're supposed to:

Notes:
~ Having no idea how to search for pseudocode for a behavior to implement, I tried to implement the boid algorithm: http://www.kfish.org/boids/pseudocode.html
~ I think for implementing an algorith that is supposed to have the balls, or boids, move independently based on one another and not have the collective whole affect one boid
at a time, I think the implementation kind of works. However, there is definitely a better behavior, like a more player interactive one, that I could have implemented if I 
thought of or found one.
~ The current implementation is very finicky in flip-flopping between actually clustering and shooting balls off in random direction (for being too close?)
