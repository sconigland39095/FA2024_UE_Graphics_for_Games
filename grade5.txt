99/100 - Total (115 possible with extra credit)

[1] Used LogTemp rather than making your own log category.

[2] Did not check file identification line

[3] Scale should be itr *= 0xffff / MaxValue, rather than itr /= MaxValue

[4] Max adjustment loop should use &itr so you can modify it

[5] Did not check for endian or swap bytes if necessary

[6] With [3,4], I was able to import the 16-bit present dataset (that one didn't need the endian swap, so did not need [5]). Shows that the rest of your 16-bit import code was working.
