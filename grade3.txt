[1] One Binaries file slipped through, but I see you changed the .gitignore after, so I'm not counting off for that this time.

[2] Getting good results from crowd and boid systems is notoriously dependent on the balance of the force components. I said to add UPROPERTY scale parameters specifically so you could tweak and balance these live. Try it! It'll be much easier to get good results.
