56/100 - Total (up to 115 with extra credit)

[1] Should be in Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Classes/Materials alongside MaterialExpressionRgbToHsv.h. This project is about making changes to the core engine code.

[2] Created an FVector2D for UV. Did still have the FExpressionInput for Input, but did not rename.

[3] Created in its own file, though that is OK. Did not update caption for new node name.

[4] Did not replicate these bits from the RgbToHsv implementation.

[5] GenerateHLSLExpression function exists, but unchanged from RgbToHsv.

[6] No shader code

[7] Not working well enough for screen shots.
