Notes:
~ Everything seems to be working: UE5 is up & running. I have completed all the tasks
  up to writing this text file for the first time.
~ So that UE5 doesn't lag so much, I changed my Engine Scalability Setting from
  Epic to Medium
~ UE5 keeps telling me that video memory has been exhausted so expect extremely poor 
  performance. I don't know what that means or if I should be concerned. The changed
  Engine Scalability Setting did not fix this; nor did changing the Project
  Setting's Global Illumination & Reflection (according to Google).
