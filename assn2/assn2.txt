Notes:
~ Everything up to the Maze Construction Step worked. 
~ The implemented Maze Construction algorithm does not work completely.
  ~ My algorithm...
	~ Creates a border for the maze, but for some reason the bottom row extends farther than it should.
	~ Creates HORIZONTAL walls within the maze, but for some reason won't place VERTICAL.
	~ Doesn't seem to make gaps in the wall for one to enter and leave the maze.
