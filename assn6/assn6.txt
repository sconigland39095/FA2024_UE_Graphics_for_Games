Screenshots:
~ Couldn't compile to get screenshots

Notes:
~ Nothing works. It doesn't compile
~ After finding the assigned RGBToHSV class, I copied it over into a new class
.cpp & .h file, respectively, but then errors would pop up when I compile. I've tried taking
functions and libraries from other files to fix them, but I have been stuck at the trying
to get FExpressionSelect decalared error. I'm too frustrated to continue.
